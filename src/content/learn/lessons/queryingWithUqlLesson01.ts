export const QUERYING_WITH_UQL_LESSON_01 = `# Your First UQL Pipeline

In the previous lesson you learned the *shape* of the graph — interfaces,
object types, and links. This lesson teaches you to **ask it questions**
using UQL, the engine's native cross-modal query language.

## What UQL is

Most graph databases give you one lens: a graph-traversal language, or a
vector search, or full-text — pick one. UQL composes graph traversal, vector
similarity, lexical (BM25) search, bi-temporal time travel, federation across
external sources, and epistemic belief/evidence reasoning **in a single
pipelined query**, all executed against one consistent snapshot. It's the text
surface for the exact same structured plan the platform's own query planner
builds internally — there's no separate "toy" query language and "real" one
underneath.

## The pipeline model

Every UQL query has the same shape:

\`\`\`
source |> stage |> stage |> ...
\`\`\`

\`source\` seeds an ordered set of candidate rows (an id, plus an optional
score). Each \`|>\`-separated **stage** takes that row set and produces a new
one — filter it, re-rank it, traverse from it, whatever. Think Unix pipes, but
each stage understands graph structure, vectors, and text instead of bytes.

**The one rule that never has an exception: every query starts with \`MATCH\`.**

\`\`\`uql
MATCH (:Label) [WHERE ...]
\`\`\`

\`REASON\`, \`FOREIGN\`, \`AS OF\`, \`TEXT\`, \`RANK BY\`, and every other stage keyword
can only appear *after* \`|>\`, never as the very first token. (There's a subtle
executor-level rule where a stage fed an *empty* row set effectively re-seeds
itself — which is how you'll sometimes see \`REASON\` or \`AS OF\` acting
source-like right after a \`MATCH\` that matched nothing on purpose — but the
text always opens with \`MATCH\`.)

## Your first query: MATCH + WHERE

The simplest possible query selects everything of one type:

\`\`\`uql
MATCH (:Document)
\`\`\`

Add a filter with \`WHERE\` — comparisons (\`>\`, \`<\`, \`=\`) joined with \`AND\`
(there's no \`OR\` or \`NOT\` at this stage — compose those with separate queries
or a later stage instead):

\`\`\`uql
MATCH (:Event) WHERE level > 3
\`\`\`

## Traversal and ranking

\`TRAVERSE\` walks graph edges a bounded number of hops:

\`\`\`uql
MATCH (:Doc) |> TRAVERSE -[:CITES]->{1,2}
\`\`\`

That's "every \`Doc\`, then follow \`CITES\` edges 1 to 2 hops out."

\`RANK BY ~[...]\` re-orders the current row set by cosine similarity to a
literal embedding-space query vector — **not** a fixed "axis 0 = relevance,
axis 1 = recency" scheme; the vector's dimensionality just has to match
whatever embeddings the bound semantic store actually uses:

\`\`\`uql
MATCH (:Doc) |> TRAVERSE -[:CITES]->{1,2} |> RANK BY ~[0.1, 0.9, 0.0] |> LIMIT 10
\`\`\`

\`LIMIT <k>\` is a terminal, order-respecting top-k — almost every query ends
with one.

## Worked examples

These are real, grounded examples (not simplified toys) — the same ones the
\`graph-query-and-explanation\` skill's UQL reference documents:

\`\`\`uql
# Filter, then traverse, then rank, then cap.
MATCH (:Doc) WHERE year > 2024 |> TRAVERSE -[:CITES]->{1,2} |> RANK BY ~[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0] |> LIMIT 10

# Federated + bi-temporal + windowed + traversal, composed in one line.
MATCH (:Event) WHERE level > 3 |> FOREIGN "peer-west" |> AS OF @1700000000 |> WINDOW 1 h |> TRAVERSE -[:CAUSED]->{1,2} |> LIMIT 10

# Fuse a vector rank and a lexical search, then re-rank by distance from a node.
MATCH (:Doc) |> FUSE [RANK BY ~[1.0, 0.0]] [TEXT "graph databases"] [RERANK NODE_DISTANCE FROM "n1"] |> LIMIT 5

# OWL-reasoner-inferred membership (note the empty MATCH — REASON re-seeds it).
MATCH (:NoSuchLabel) |> REASON <http://ex/Device> |> RANK BY ~[0.2, 0.4, -0.1] |> LIMIT 5

# Epistemic: evidence for a claim, as believed at a point in time.
MATCH (:Claim) |> EVIDENCE FOR "c1" |> BELIEF AS OF @1700000000 |> LIMIT 10
\`\`\`

## Where to go from here

- Run a UQL query for real via \`engine_query(action='uql', text='MATCH (:Document) |> LIMIT 5')\`
  — note the keyword is \`text\`, not \`query\`. An unsupported clause in your
  build returns a clean \`{"error": ...}\`, never a silently wrong answer.
- Don't want to hand-write UQL yet? \`graph_ask\`/\`nl_query\` translate a plain
  natural-language question into a query (Cypher, SQL, or UQL) for you, and
  return the generated query alongside the answer so you can learn from it.
- The full grammar — every clause, every \`Op\`, and ~20 more worked examples —
  lives in \`references/uql-reference.md\` in the \`graph-query-and-explanation\`
  skill.
- SPARQL and SHACL are separate, standards-based surfaces for RDF/OWL data —
  see this web UI's **SPARQL & SHACL** view if you'd rather query the
  ontology itself that way.

That's the whole mental model: pick a \`MATCH\`, pipe it through stages with
\`|>\`, end with \`LIMIT\`. Everything else in UQL is just more stage keywords
layered onto that same shape.
