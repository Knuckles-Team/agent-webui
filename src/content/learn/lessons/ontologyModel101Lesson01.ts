export const ONTOLOGY_MODEL_101_LESSON_01 = `# Interfaces, Object Types, and Links

This lesson is the first stop in **Ontology School** — a short, practical tour
of the ontology model that underpins the whole Knowledge Graph. By the end
you'll be able to read (and reason about) the platform's own schema.

## Why an ontology model at all?

A Knowledge Graph without a schema is just a pile of nodes and edges — anyone
can call anything anything. This platform's ontology layer
(\`agent_utilities/knowledge_graph/ontology/\`) gives every object a **typed
shape**: named properties with real types, and named, cardinalitied
relationships to other objects. That's what lets a Function, an Action, or a
query be written *once* against a type and keep working as the underlying data
grows — and it's what lets tools like \`ontology_interface(action='lint')\`
catch a typo in a property name before it ships.

The model has three moving parts: **interfaces**, **object types**, and
**link types**. This lesson covers each in turn.

## Interfaces: abstract shape contracts

An **Interface** is an *abstract* schema element — it never has instances of
its own. It declares a **shape**: a set of required properties, plus optional
link constraints every implementing object type must satisfy. Two built-in
examples ship at import (\`register_builtin_interfaces\`):

- \`HasProvenance\` — anything that must carry \`source\`, \`ingested_at\`, and
  similar audit properties.
- \`Locatable\` — anything that has a physical or logical location.

Interfaces can **extend** other interfaces (an interface may have several
parents), so a sub-interface inherits its parents' required properties and
link constraints automatically.

The payoff is **programmatic targeting**: a Function, Action, or query can
name an interface instead of a concrete type. At call time the platform
resolves that interface to *every* concrete object type that implements it —
\`InterfaceRegistry.find_implementers()\` is exactly that resolution step. Write
a risk-scoring Function against the \`HasProvenance\` interface once, and it
runs unmodified against every object type that implements it, today and in
the future.

## Object types: the concrete instances

An **object type** is what actually gets instantiated — \`Customer\`, \`Order\`,
\`Incident\`, \`CodeSymbol\`. An object type **implements** zero or more
interfaces by calling \`InterfaceRegistry.implement()\`, which doesn't just
record the claim — it **validates** it, collecting any missing required
property or unsatisfied link constraint into an \`ImplementationReport\`. There
is no silent, unchecked "trust me, I implement this" path.

Note the asymmetry with a typical demo ontology tool: many such tools treat
every entity as directly concrete (no interface/implementation split). This
platform keeps the two concepts distinct on purpose — it's the same
abstract-contract-plus-concrete-implementer split used by large-scale
enterprise ontology platforms, and it's what makes interface-targeted
Functions and Actions possible.

## Link types: typed, cardinalitied edges

A **LinkType** defines a typed relationship between two object (node) types —
mirroring how an enterprise ontology platform defines a *link type* between
two object types. Three things make a link type more than "just an edge":

1. **A named, directed edge type** (\`edge_type\`, a real \`RegistryEdgeType\`),
   so the link can be written and traversed deterministically in both
   directions.
2. **A cardinality** — \`ONE_TO_ONE\`, \`ONE_TO_MANY\`, or \`MANY_TO_MANY\` — which
   is enforced, not decorative.
3. **A source and target object type**, so \`ontology_interface(action='graph')\`
   can render the whole schema (interfaces + object types + their links) as
   one interactive node/edge graph — see the **Schema View** in this web UI.

## Junction link types: many-to-many with their own data

A plain \`MANY_TO_MANY\` link connects two object types, but sometimes the
relationship itself carries data — an \`Employee\` ↔ \`Project\` link that also
needs a \`role\` and an \`allocation\` percentage. Modeling that as a bare edge
loses the data; modeling it as two separate one-to-many links loses the
relationship's identity.

The fix is **reification**: a \`JunctionLinkType\` declares an intermediary
**junction object type** (e.g. \`Assignment\`) that carries the link's own
properties, plus two edges connecting it to each endpoint. In graph terms,
this is exactly the standard reified-edge pattern: a junction *node* plus two
directed edges. \`materialize_junction()\` turns a junction link definition plus
a concrete pair of endpoint ids into real, ready-to-write graph objects — no
stub, real provenance stamped on the junction node. \`endpoints_of()\`,
\`neighbors_via()\`, and \`junctions_for()\` walk a materialized junction back to
its endpoints, so the reified relationship is navigable in both directions,
just like a plain link.

## Try it yourself

Everything in this lesson is live in the running platform, not just
documentation:

- \`ontology_interface(action='list')\` — every registered interface.
- \`ontology_interface(action='implementers', name='HasProvenance')\` — every
  concrete type that implements a given interface.
- \`ontology_interface(action='graph')\` — the whole schema (interfaces, object
  types, and their links) as one Cytoscape-style node/edge graph — the same
  payload this web UI's **Schema View** renders.
- \`ontology_interface(action='summary')\` — the same schema as a readable
  Markdown document.
- \`ontology_interface(action='lint')\` — naming-convention and typo checks
  against the live interface registry.

Next lesson: **Querying with UQL** — now that you can read the shape of the
graph, learn to ask it questions.
