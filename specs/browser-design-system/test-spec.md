# Design-system verification

| Test | Fixture | Pass |
|---|---|---|
| Token contrast | Light/dark token table | Text and controls meet WCAG 2.2 AA contrast where applicable |
| Keyboard and focus | Chat, Atlas filter/query/result, operational form | Full task completion, visible focus, correct dialog focus restore |
| Accessible names | Repeated Atlas clauses and error forms | Unique names, associated errors, sensible announcements |
| Responsive | 320/375/768/1440px screenshots | No overflow or unreachable primary action |
| Motion and touch | Reduced-motion and touch profile | Equivalent action/feedback without gesture or animation |
| States | Loading/empty/stale/denied/error/success fixtures | Text distinctions, no color-only meaning |
| Reuse/privacy | Source/asset/dependency audit | No duplicate primitive, real-user data or telemetry request |

Run `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run test`, `pnpm run test:e2e`, `pnpm run build`, and `pre-commit run --config .config/pre-commit.yaml --all-files` on the exact commit. E2E provisions local fixtures and browser; no live hosted environment is required for a PR. CCCC's configured staged rule rejects new functions above cyclomatic 10/cognitive 15 and regressions. Use configured jscpd and Dupehound if available; missing configuration is a gap. KISS requires adapting existing components and tokens before adding a primitive. Record automated accessibility findings plus manual keyboard/screen-reader notes and screenshot artifact digests in `tasks.md`.
